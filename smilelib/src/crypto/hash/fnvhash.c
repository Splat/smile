* Fowler/Noll/Vo hash
*
* The basis of this hash algorithm was taken from an idea sent
* as reviewer comments to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2 committee by:
*
*      Phong Vo (http://www.research.att.com/info/kpv/)
*      Glenn Fowler (http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/)
*
* In a subsequent ballot round:
*
*      Landon Curt Noll (http://www.isthe.com/chongo/)
*
* improved on their algorithm.  Some people tried this hash
* and found that it worked rather well.  In an EMail message
* to Landon, they named it the ``Fowler/Noll/Vo'' or FNV hash.
*
* FNV hashes are designed to be fast while maintaining a low
* collision rate. The FNV speed allows one to quickly hash lots
* of data while maintaining a reasonable collision rate.  See:
*
*      http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/index.html
*
* for more details as well as other forms of the FNV hash.
***
*
* To use the recommended 32 bit FNV-1a hash, pass FNV1_32A_INIT as the
* Fnv32_t hashval argument to fnv_32a_buf() or fnv_32a_str().
