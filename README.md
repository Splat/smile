**This is the C implementation of the Smile Programming Language.**

Smile is a functional, object-oriented, dynamically-typed programming
language with a flexible syntax.  It is heavily inspired by Lisp and
Smalltalk and JavaScript, and is as mutatable and extensible as a true
Lisp, but it reads more like Python or Ruby.

More information on Smile can be found at http://www.smile-lang.org.  An
informal development blog can also be found at http://www.werkema.com.

(*Note: This implementation is currently very incomplete but growing,
and it will eventually become the official implementation.  If you want
the much-more-complete and fairly-usable C# implementation, you'll need
to look elsewhere, as it's not hosted here.*)
